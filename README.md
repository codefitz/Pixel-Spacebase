Pixel Spacebase
===============

This is a fork of Shattered Pixel Dungeon v4.3, based on Pixel Dungeon. I'm new to coding in a statically typed language like Java - this is primarily a hobby/learning project but I hope it might grow into a nice spin on the endless PD forks.

* Original by Watabou: https://github.com/watabou/pixel-dungeon
* Shattered by Evan D: https://github.com/00-Evan/shattered-pixel-dungeon

I started out with the original build of PD but ran into unending complications with the random level size generation. Since I decided that I wanted this to be a core feature (but also wanted to get on with my game changes), I opted for Shattered, but I'm not keen on the newer perspective, so forked the previous version with the original graphics.

Still, massive credit to Evan for reworking level generation - I stand on the shoulders of tiny pixel giants.
